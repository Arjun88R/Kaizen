AI Job Tracker
An intelligent browser extension designed to automate and streamline the job application tracking process. This tool allows users to save job postings from any website with a single click, using AI to automatically parse and store key details, eliminating the need for manual data entry into spreadsheets.

Key Features
One-Click Tracking: A simple browser extension to capture job application details directly from the job posting page.

AI-Powered Data Extraction: Leverages the Google Gemini API to intelligently parse unstructured text from webpages and extract structured data like company name, job title, and location.

Advanced Web Scraping: Utilizes a headless browser engine to accurately render and scrape content from complex, JavaScript-heavy job portals.

Cloud Database Storage: Securely saves all tracked job applications to a central Cloud Firestore database for persistent storage.

Serverless Architecture: Built on a highly scalable, cost-effective serverless backend using Firebase Cloud Functions, requiring zero server management.

Web Dashboard: A React-based web application to view, filter, and manage all tracked jobs in a centralized dashboard.
